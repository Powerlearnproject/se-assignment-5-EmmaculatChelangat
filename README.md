3. Open Settings: Type >Preferences: Open Settings (UI) to open the settings editor.
4. Install Extensions: Type >Extensions: Install Extensions to open the Extensions view and install new extensions.

5. Extensions in VS Code:
   - Discuss the role of extensions in VS Code. How can users find, install, and manage extensions? Provide examples of essential extensions for web development.
Extensions in Visual Studio Code (VS Code) play a crucial role in enhancing the functionality and customization of the editor. They allow users to add new features, integrate with other tools and services, and tailor the development environment to specific needs and preferences.
Open the Extensions view by clicking on the Extensions icon in the Activity Bar on the side of the window or by pressing Ctrl+Shift+X.
Once you find the extension you want to install, click the Install button. The extension will be downloaded and installed automatically.

Managing Extensions
View Installed Extensions: Open the Extensions view (Ctrl+Shift+X or Cmd+Shift+X) to see a list of installed extensions.
Disable/Enable Extensions: In the Extensions view, you can disable or enable extensions by clicking the gear icon next to the extension and selecting Disable or Enable.
Uninstall Extensions: To uninstall an extension, click the gear icon next to the extension and select Uninstall.
Update Extensions: If an extension has an update available, youâ€™ll see an update button next to it in the Extensions view. Click Update to install the latest version.

Essential Extensions for Web Development
1. Prettier - Code formatter: Automatically formats your code according to a set of rules and styles, improving readability and consistency.
2. ESLint: Integrates ESLint into VS Code to lint your JavaScript and TypeScript code, helping you find and fix problems based on predefined rules.
3. Live Server: Launches a local development server with live reload feature for static and dynamic pages.

6. Integrated Terminal:
   - Describe how to open and use the integrated terminal in VS Code. What are the advantages of using the integrated terminal compared to an external terminal?
Go to the View menu at the top of the window then Select Terminal or Keyboard Shortcut: Press Ctrl+ for Windows
Using the Integrated Terminal
1. Creating and Switching Terminals:
New Terminal: Click the + icon in the terminal panel or use the Command Palette by typing >Terminal: Create New Integrated Terminal.
Switching Terminals: If you have multiple terminals open, switch between them using the drop-down menu in the terminal panel.
2. Terminal Tabs: Each terminal session opens in a new tab. You can navigate between them by clicking on the tabs or using the Ctrl+ and Ctrl+Shift+ Windows.
3. Split Terminal: Click the split terminal icon to create a side-by-side terminal split or use the Command Palette with >Terminal: Split Terminal.
4. Configuring the Terminal: Open settings (Ctrl+ ), search for "terminal," and configure settings like the default shell, font size, and cursor style.
5. Running Commands: Type commands directly into the terminal just as you would in any other terminal emulator. For example:ls, git status, npm install

 Advantages
1. Convenience: The integrated terminal is embedded within VS Code, allowing you to access it without switching between different applications. This streamlines the workflow and keeps your development environment consolidated.
2. Context Awareness: The integrated terminal automatically opens in the context of the workspace or project folder, meaning it starts in the root directory of your project by default. This reduces the need to navigate directories manually.
3. Synchronization: Commands and actions in the integrated terminal are closely synchronized with the state of the editor. For example, opening a new terminal session will reflect the current working directory of the open file in the editor.
4. Integrated Experience: The integrated terminal can interact directly with the VS Code environment. For instance, you can use code . to open the current directory in a new VS Code window directly from the terminal.

  
7. File and Folder Management:
   - Explain how to create, open, and manage files and folders in VS Code. How can users navigate between different files and directories efficiently?
